Spacebuild Enhancement Pack
Copyright (C) 2012-2014 Spacebuild Development Team

Credit goes to Cheesman52 for the original idea:
ere is my idea. Somebody could make a models pack with pre-built parts for
ships. I'm not talking about a entire pre made ship I'm talking about the
parts. We could have hall ways,pre built ship hulls with holes on the side so
we can connect like other parts to main hull. I love space build but making a
closed ship that looks good takes a while. This would cut time by alot and give
more time for exploring. You could also have individual parts for like space
stations. Could have a central p remade hub and have p remade hall ways to
connect to other rooms. I don't know much about lag and stuff like that but I
think these thing would reduce lag. Instead of having a bunch of props for a
space station you could have as little as one. Please leave positive feedback.
Sorry for bad spelling, my sister spill t juice on keyboard and now it all
sticky. Please give me gold stars if you like it please!
